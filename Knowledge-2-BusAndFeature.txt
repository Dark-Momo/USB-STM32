1. USB 2.0 Cable Structure
There are 4 wires in USB 2.0 cable: VBUS, GND, D+/D-. And thee is a shield layer outside.
VBUS, and GND can be used to power up bus-powered device.

2. USB Main Feature
(1) Hot-plug
Just plug, don't need to restart or install driver. Host and device will negotiate about a proper driver and configuration.
So USB is self-configured. 

(2) Bus-power and Self-power
Devices that consumes not that much power can be USB bus-powered;
Otherwise, the device should be self-powered; 

(3) Host controlled
There always be one, and only one, host that controls all communications on the bus. It doesn't matter how many devices 
are connected.

(4) Vendor ID (VID) and Product ID (PID)
Every USB device have these 2 IDs hardcoded. 
For example, a mouse of the same model, from the same vendor, should have the same VID and PID. 
But they should have different Serial Number.

(5) Device Address
Everytime a deive is connected to host, host will assign this device an unique address. This address will change for next hot-plug.
 
(6) Device Enumeration
During initial negotiation, host will recognize what the device is, what speed, and what driver for this device.

(7) Bus polling/sampling
Both host and device poll the bus to know the bus's current state, and then determine according actions. USB doesn't have interrupt.
The bus state should stay enough long to wait for next polling.

3. USB Bus Topology
In USB, host and devices are connected to bus according to "tiered-start" topology. Up to 127 devices can be connected to bus incluing
hubs. 
(1) Device address is 7-bit and address 0 is reserved as initial address for every single newly connected device.
(2) The maximum number of ties, or the maximum number of devices that are allowed to connect in series is 7;
(5) Up to 5 hubs are allowed to be connected in series directly;
