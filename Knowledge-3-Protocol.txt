1. Differential States
Full and High Speed 	: 1 when D+ high > D- low, 0 when D+ low < D- high;
Low Speed               	: 1 when D+ < D-, 0 when D+ > D-;

Bus lines are by default pulled to low by 2 resistors(15K) at host side;
(1) Low Speed also pulls D- to 3.3V at device side using 1.5K;
(2) High/Full Speed also pulls D+ to 3.3V at device side using 1.5K;

2. Bus State
- SE0: Both lines(D+ and D-) are low;
- Detached: SE0;
- Idle: Differential 1;
- J: Differential 1;
- K: Opposite to J state;

- Reset(Host asks device to reset itself): SE0 > 10ms;
- Suspend: When in Idle > 3ms; to save power;
- Resume(from Suspend): K > 20ms then a EOP;
- Sync or Start of Packet(SOP): KJKJKJKK;
- END Of Packet(EOP): SE0 SE0 J;

3. Bit stuffing
Insert non-information bits into data.
In USB HS/FS, insert zero after six consecutive ones to ensure state transition so that clock can sync.
