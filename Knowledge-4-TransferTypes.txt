1. There are 4 transfer/endpoint types
- Interrupt transfer/endpoint;
- Bulk transfer/endpoint;
- Isochronous transfer/endpoint;
- Control transfer/endpoint: Endpoint 0 for configure;

USB device tells the host about the configuration of its endpoints in the early stage of device enumeration.

2. Interrupt endpoint/transfer
- Though the name has 'interrupt', it is still polling. The interrupt here means its signal's latency is guaranteed.
- Periodic transfer with regular update from device, and guaranteed bandwidth(limited known latency).
  Limited latency : A device can send interrupt transfer to host at a interval of no more than a certain number of time.
- Error-free transfer, which means it has error detection;
- Maximum payload : up to 64-Byte for FS, and 1024-Byte for HS(Small piece of data);
- Example : Mouse, Keyboard, Joystick;

Interrupt transfer has handshake, which means no matter host or device, when it receives request/data from other
side, it needs to send back a ACK(everything ok)/NAK(not ready yet)/STALL(error).

Check page [Interrupt endpoint/transfer] in slides.

3. Bulk endpoint/transfer
- Non-periodic transfer (need based);
- Has handshake; 

Check page [Bulk endpoint/transfer] in slides.

4. Isochronous endpoint/transfer
- Periodic transfer;
- NO handshake;
- No error checking;

Check page [Isochronous endpoint/transfer] in slides.

5. Control endpoint/transfer
- Non-periodic, error-free;
- Endpoint 0 (IN and OUT) must be configured to operate as Control Transfer;
- Enumeration happens on Endpoint 0;

Every control transfer consists of three stages:
1. The Setup Stage (one transaction);
2. The Data Stage (Optional; zero to multiple transactions);
3. The Status Stage (one transaction);
